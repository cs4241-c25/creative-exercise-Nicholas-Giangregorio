## Silly screen
- https://creative-exercise-nicholas-giangregorio.glitch.me
- Canvas
- Not specifically based on anything, I just used a bunch of the stuff taught on the W3 Schools tutorial
- It doesn't exactly DO anything, it just shows a silly page using the required elements. Maybe you could call it modern art?
